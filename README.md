## üí° Motivation
I built Recipe Finder to simplify the process of finding cooking inspiration. Many recipe websites are cluttered with ads and unnecessary content, making it difficult to quickly find what you need. This app focuses on providing a clean, fast, and enjoyable experience for home cooks of all skill levels.
